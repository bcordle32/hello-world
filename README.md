# hello-world

Hi All!

My name is Brenton, and I am working through the tutorial to GitHub. I have done some programming before, but mainly to solve mathmatical problems. I am looking to learn more about software development, and hope to gain, at the very least, a basic understanding of how software is generated from an idea into a working useful program. I want to know the common pitfalls for new programmers, and how best to avoid them. My background is in Chemical Engineering, and I may want to focus on generating software for my own ease of use, or potentially for fun (as in creating games). If anyone other than myself reads this, thanks! It is strange that you would spend your time reading through the (probably) thousands on "hello-world" tutorial repositories when there are so many other interesting things on here.
